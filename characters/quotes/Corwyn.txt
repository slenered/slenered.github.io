“What does it say?”<br>

“By the way, Mardok, this is Corwyn. He’s only four years older that I am. We used to get into trouble together since we are the youngest two.” Corwyn stuck his tongue out at me but held his hand out to Mardok.#

“Good to meet you, Brother. In all honesty, you’re unlike any sibling I’ve ever had. And a bit...” He lifted his hand up to the top of Mardok’s head. “… quite a bit taller.”#

“Yes, they appear to be fire-breathing rabbits.”<br>
Corwyn, who had been tossing nuts and berries into his mouth, choked on one. He began coughing violently.#

Corwyn and I didn’t find the view particularly inspiring.<br>
“Grey. Drab.” He paused. “Looks like any other castle.”#
