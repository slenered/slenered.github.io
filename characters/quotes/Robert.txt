“Meira, then. Your name is as beautiful as you are.  Don’t get excited. It’s my only line, and I say it to every girl.”#

I dropped off my horse and stepped inside the residence of Robert Everet, king of West Haulay. He was, as usual, easily located in the kitchen.#
*
“He's a good king – not like most of those kings out there.”#
*
“So, only moderately embarrassing, not full fledged scandal,” I offered.<br>
“Sadly, it seems that way,” Robert agreed. “Nothing worthy of a public pillary.”#
*
Robert had, without consulting the Counsel of Dukes, declared that most of his kingdom now belonged to the Fae. A wise man would have pointed out that it always had.#
*
Robert flopped down in a large chair across from us and threw his leg over the arm. He tossed his crown on a pile of socks on the floor. #
*
“Besides, I’m a king. I don’t need sleep. I have servants who sleep for me. And in the morning, nobody can leave without me. I practically own the place.”#
*
“What does it take for a gentleman to move aside and let a lady join him?” Meira called out from behind us.<br>
“I supposed there would have to be a gentleman present to accommodate such a thing,” Robert replied.#
*
“Famusing?” Julia inquired.<br>
“Yes,” Robert replied. “It’s ‘funny’ and ‘amusing’ together – the worst of both worlds.  We did a very poor job demonstrating our famusement for Meira, so we must work extra hard to de-famuse her parents.”#
