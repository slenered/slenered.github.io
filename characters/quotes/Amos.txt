I left the forest and found Amos, the oldest of the Dozen, leaning against a tree, smoking his pipe.<br>
“That will kill you, you know,” I remarked.#
*
I would never, for any reason, level a thought against Amos, much less speak belittling of his insights and, in this case, admonition. I knew I had been found out, and my guilty silence was the only answer I had for him.#

“You were my father’s only real friend, Amos. I called you uncle until you made me stop.”<br>
“Then my friendship demands that I do what’s best for you, not merely what’s happy.”#

He stood and stared at me for a while. Then he pulled his pipe and tin from his coat pocket. “Mardok,” he started, pausing for a lengthy time while he filled his pipe and lit it. “Are you telling me... or telling yourself?”#

“Would it make your own life better if you knew?” he queried.<br>
“No, but it's going to drive me mad if you don't.”<br>
“Enjoy your madness, Mardok.”#
