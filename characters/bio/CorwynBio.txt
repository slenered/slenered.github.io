Corwyn has ambitious plans to become the #1 New York Times, USA Today, Salon, and Babylon Bee bestselling author of an upcoming outstanding historically-accurate high fantasy series.  The first book, Ardor and Allegiance, will hit book stores with a bang, just as soon as they are printed and delivered.<br>
<br>
Corwyn is also working on a second series, conveniently named Robert and Shelly after the ignoble main characters.  Robert and Shelly is a horribly irreverent series that will offend virtually everyone, especially the people who aren't reading it.<br>
<br>
Corwyn also writes things he will never admit to.<br>
