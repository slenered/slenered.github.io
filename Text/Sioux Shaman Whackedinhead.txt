Situated on the American-Canadian border, a small group of Sioux pulled together the last of their will, their ammo, and their fire water.  To the north, the Mounties were denying them entrance.  To the south, a group of wild-eyed, flag-waving, Bible-thumping cavalry of the United States Army’s 4th Injun-Fightin’ Battalion were looking to finish off the last of their prey.
