A group of ROTC cadets marched across the lawn, doing their best to look impressive under the perfect California skies. One of the fem majors strutted past them, flashing a pair of middle fingers.<br>
<br>
While Shelly agreed with the sentiment that the military should not be located on college campuses, she had not quite bought into the idea that harassing the participants would have a positive effect in removing them.<br>
<br>
She put her head aback in Andrea Nye. Who knows, maybe Andres had real answers for her.<br>
<br>
“Hey, you.” Melissa dropped onto a step beside Shelly. She was wearing her usual thick jacket, even though the sun was shining. “Ready for the test?”<br>
<br>
“Think so. Andrea’s a pretty easy read,” Shelly replied. She slapped the book shut and looked back at the ROTC cadets. The boy third from the back on the left was completely out of step. It’s amazing how it only took one to make the entire unit look silly.<br>
<br>
“We’re getting together later to protest, if you want to come,” Melissa offered.<br>
<br>
“Maybe. We’ve got that project due tomorrow, though.” Shelly had not yet been to one of the protests. She did, however, express her sympathy and support for them in general. But truth be known, they always took place on days she was simply packed with homework – which was pretty much every day.<br>
<br>
“Dr. Fender said we would get extra credit and a two day extension for attending.”<br>
<br>
“Really?”<br>
<br>
“Do you ever check your email?”<br>
<br>
Shelly pulled her phone, ignored another pair of text messages from her mother, and opened her email. Sure enough, there was the professor’s offer for postponement.<br>
<br>
“Well,” she replied, weighing the distinct impact to her grade, “I’m in. Do I respond to this or something?”<br>
<br>
“Nah. It’s on the honor system. Would you like to help make signs?”<br>
<br>
“Sure… why not?” Shelly was not actually excited by this prospect, but it seemed like a functional way to get to know the other girls in the protest group. She was well aware that she had not yet earned any cred on campus. She was falling far behind the social curve, given she was now a junior without a single “battle incident,” as the other students called them. Battle incidents could be acquired by confrontations with right-winders on campus, by disrupting extremist events, or by having a really good story to tell about being victimized by a hater or a bigot or a male. Protests only garnered ground-level cred, but this was usually required to work your way up through the cred tier.<br>
<br>
If she had been at the school during the previous two years, she already would have worked her way through the social tiers. She had a knack for such things. But she was a transfer to Mid Drift University. Her first two years has been at Vancouver Community College, down the street from where she had grown up. She had been told during high school that taking your first two years in community college was a wise financial choice. And since her parents had enforced it through a lack of funding, Shelly had complied. But having been here for only two months, she had become disenchanted with the whole concept of “financial wisdom.” There was more to life, she was learning – things that extended beyond mere money. Her parents, Shelly determined, had been keeping their hands over her eyes.<br>
<br>
She put Andrea Nye back in her bag and stood up.<br>
<br>
“Where are we meeting?”<br>
<br>
“Ummm...” Melissa scanned through her emails. “At Shaw Hall.”<br>
<br>
“Alright. Let’s go.”<br>
<br>
They walked through the grass to George Bernard Shaw Hall, where a bronze statue of the socialist author looked over the lawn in approval. Inside, tables and floor space were filled with various signs, saying things such as, “Don’t touch me!!!” and “Free healthcare for All!”<br>
<br>
“Soooo...” Shelly started, “What’s the protest about?”<br>
<br>
“Well, we haven’t really decided yet,” Melissa answered. “We were going to do one against Senator Billback. But he resigned, and everyone condemned him. So not a lot of interest there. So then we found out that this church nearby is doing this thing, so we were going to protest that. But someone found out this it was just a funeral for their pastor, and we figured that would be a bad image. We put them back on the list for sometime in the spring.”<br>
<br>
Shelly looked at a few more signs, including, “No lives are worth Black Lives!” and “Everyone is human!”<br>
<br>
“So then we were, like, um, what do we do now? So we decided to just protest capitalism and right-wing hatred…. Cuz that’s still a thing.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, makes sense.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, cuz until those !@^#!#$ &@$% give it up, we can keep pushing on it. At some point we’ll drive those Nazi *$%^$ !#$%#$^ &*#$%@ so crazy, they’ll just have to stop hating us.”<br>
<br>
Shelly’s brain prodded her that something was amiss with this logic, but Andrea Nye had been warning her to avoid listening to logic, since it was a function of the patriarchy and cemented masculine dominance.<br>
<br>
Shelly took several pre-traced signs and painted in the lettering. A few of the did not make any sense, but Shelly reasoned that making a determination on what made sense and what did not was not only reinforcing the same pattern of logical fallacies espoused by Aristotle, but it was probably also a sign of feeling one’s own cultural superiority. So she passed through three hours writing things that may or may not have been reflective of sensibility.<br>
<br>
“Ten minutes!” one of the girls shouted. Shelly jerked up her head. She had been wandering around in her own thoughts --- mostly consisting of shocking her parents with her new-found knowledge. In her mind, though, she kept running into her father saying, “Your feelings are lying to you.” It was a mantra of his, and she had not yet found answer to it other than to scream at him. And that had never quite working in the past.<br>
<br>
Her favorite sign said, “Assuming THIS!” printed in giant black letters with a large orange K underneath. She had absolutely no idea what was meant by this, but she was pretty sure that was the whole point.<br>
<br>
They grabbed the whole lot of signs and exited. A large group was already gathering.<br>
<br>
“We’re going down to the street!” one of of the organizers shouted. Everyone complied. Without a specific target, it didn’t seem to make any difference to Melissa where they protested, as long as people could see them. Chanting gave way to yelling. Yelling gave way to being ignored. Being ignored gave way to people standing in the middle of the street to block traffic. This, in turn, resulted in drivers honking at them, which they replied to with screaming and beating on cars. Two girls who were fighting masculine dominance worked themselves into such a frenzy that they tore off their tops. Shortly thereafter, one male driver rear-ended another. One of the girls screamed at the ogling boy, “My face is up here, pervert!”<br>
<br>
In the midst of the insanity and chaos, Shelly found her center. On her right, Melissa screamed random slogans at the drivers. On her left, Dr. Ruths shouted obscenities. This, Shelly felt… this was freedom; this was good. She closed her eyes and breathed in deeply – the smell of sweat, burnt rubber, and halitosis mixed with the human cries for justice, peace, and death to her enemies. In the distance police sirens erupted. The oppressive system was complaining; it was groaning under the weight of their determination.<br>
<br>
Shelly drew her fingers in a circle from the top of her head to the bottom of her torso. “In this place,” she stated, speaking directly to nature itself, “I am goddess.” She drew in a deep breath, opened her eyes, and felt a burning fire seer through her. Not since punching a tooth out of her older brother’s mouth four years ago had she felt such strength and confidence. Shelly grabbed the handle of a broken Kroger’s shopping cart that a vagrant had abandoned when they arrived. Then she stepped boldly into the street, dragging it behind her. As the next car passed, trying desperately to avoid and ignore them, Shelly pulled with all of her mustered strength, lifting the forlorn cart into a graceful arc over her right shoulder. It made contact with the vehicles driver-side window, which promptly burst into a galaxy of crystalline stars.
