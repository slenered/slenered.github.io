My dearest Robby,<br>
<br>
It's been a long time since we've spoken on good terms.  Right now I'm trying to work on myself, to make myself a better person.  To do that, I've been told by my personal coach that I should confront my biggest problems head-on and deal with them.  So, I guess that means you.  Then she told me that it would be best for the two of us if we weren't on such hostile terms.  I have to tell you, it took quite a long time to explain to her just exactly how bad it was being married to you.  But, unlike someone I know, she demonstrated that she was quite capable of staying and listening as I talked.  Just think, if you had tried that years ago... but I digress.  That's all in the past now, no?  See?  We can move on!<br>
<br>
I would like to discuss doing something different with our children.  I've worked it out so that the schedule is better for them.  I was very careful not to put either of our own interests at the forefront on this.  And I think you should look at my plan with the same selfless intent.  After all, you've told me many times that you only want what's best for the children.  I guess I'll know whether or not you were serious about that, based upon your answer.  The plan is in the attached PDF file.  If you have trouble figuring out how to open it, I'll be happy to help.<br>
<br>
Hoping for your cooperation,<br>

Robert checked the computer monitor twice of traces of venom leaking through.  He downloaded the PDF to a quarantined drive before scanning it for viruses.  Satisfied, he opened the file.  It was Empusa's recommended new child possession calendar.  Only in the best interests of the children of course, Empusa recommended eliminating nearly half of his possession time, giving him Easter and the 4th of July as substitutes.  A note read, "I know how important it is to you that you have these particular holidays, and I wanted to be accommodating."<br>
<br>
Robert leaned back in his chair and pondered.  Then he stretched out his professional, diplomatic hands to provide his response.<br>
<br>
<br>
My wonderful and lovely Empusa,<br>
<br>
I agree.  I think we should try to get back on better terms.  So, forgive me if I make a blunder or two as I sincerely try my best.  I know how much you like it when I expose my inner thoughts, so here goes.<br>
<br>
You may not know, but I still have the same sweet and passionate dreams about you that I had when we were first married and you were still attractive.  I want to thank you for all of the fabulous memories that are such tantalizing fodder for my fantasies.  It's been surreal looking at you now during possession changes -- just the devastation from age that you have put on in such a short time.  You have my most sincere sympathies.  I'm sure there's a cream or something to help with that.  Don't do it for me, of course.  I had you at your best, for as long as it lasted.  Do it for Elrik.  You know how unavoidable he finds the younger look.  Then again, as the old proverb says, time heals all wounds.  Maybe it will work out for you.<br>
<br>
I've reviewed the possession schedule you offered.  I have to say, you really worked hard at defining what you thought was good for the kids.  As best as I can tell, that includes a great many things that have nothing to do with me.  Initially I was bothered, but I decided to look at it from another perspective entirely.  So I will ponder for a while before I can provide a response.  In the meantime, please keep in touch.  I believe there is opportunity for us here.<br>

A couple of notes on being evil:<br>
<br>
1.  It's bad.<br>
<br>
2.  It's fun.
