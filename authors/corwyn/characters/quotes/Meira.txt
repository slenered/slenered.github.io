Meira turned and strode toward me, her head held high. She was wearing a basic leather outfit as promised, carrying a fresh sparring stave. “Do I pass lesson one?” she asked, as she pirouetted.#

Meira flashed me a brilliant smile as her translucent, dragonfly-like wings opened and lifted her from the ground, casting rainbows on the forest floor.#
