Hi.  I'm Kniffen.  It's not "Kniffen what?"  Just Kniffen.  I'm like Cher or Madonna or Batman that way.<br>
<br>
I was born in 3455 in Schalfrig Hahl, on the border between Meridin and P'tr.  It was an unlikely place for my birth, but the Centri had been insistent that father and mother be at the showing of the decannual star shower.  If they had known that the ulkri of P'tr had been planning a quiet attack into Meridin, it's unlikely father would have had mother there so close to my birth.  But this was something that even the Centri did not know.  They knew only that the gods were disquieted with this area, and the god Istrin was rubbing his spirity paws together in glee at whatever might be coming.<br>
<br>
It was just as well, since my grandmother Galianna was with us.  She had always been, as the historian Paladu had written about her, "significantly more powerful than a single Fae should ever be permitted."  If Paladu had known before his untimely death about the coming of my little sister Meira he may well have been a bit more reserved in his perception.<br>
<br>
But this story is for a different day, no?<br>
<br>
I spent most of my childhood doing what most sons-of-nomadic-kings-who-run-the-world do -- getting into trouble.  Where my father lacked in imaginative comedy, I was a complement from the gods.  And thus, through hard work and dedication on my part, I instilled in my father a much deeper sense of patience and anger-management than he had ever had before.  Pretty good for a guy who already had a few dozen kids.<br>
<br>
And honestly, it only improved when I figured out the reason I would occasionally wake up places I hadn't gone to bed:  I was a teleporter, and a staggeringly attractive one at that.  Why risk sneaking into my father's sleeping portico when I could blink in instead?  And after sewing his socks shut, it was just safer to blink back out again -- usually somewhere far, far, far, far, far away.<br>
<br>
Of course, all of this was a terribly long time ago.  I look back on my life before the exile, and not for a moment am I glad to be gone.  Honestly, for having a few billion humans in it, living in this strange world can be dreadfully lonely.<br>
<br>
For those interested in knowing, I'm a bit more than a few hundred years along.  I know for humans this is a rarity these days, but for me, as a High Fae, I dare say that I'm only just coming into my prime - dashing, debonair, and cultured.  Being stuck in your world has exposed me to quite a few interesting things -- perhaps the best of which is the rapid distribution of the written word.  And typing... I really like typing -- sooooo much faster.  And printers -- they help with publishing books.  And cookies.<br>
<br>
How did I come into your world, you might wonder?  Well, I'll tell ya... but not in this first book.  Not yet.  it's a fabulous story, definitely worth the read.  That's why I bothered writing it.  I know it sounds a bit arrogant to say that my life is vastly more interesting than your life, but it's not a fun thing to have an interesting life.  First, though, I want to start with the story of my little sister, Meira, a girl of fiery passion, and Mardok, a human who quite ironically became much more famous in this world than on Lur.  (Again, a story for another time.)  I know, you want the synopsis right now, but you need some real background information first, and where better to start than the events that first brought us into the land of West Haulay, into the court of the good king, Robert Adler.<br>
